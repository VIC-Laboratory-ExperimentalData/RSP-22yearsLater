# Material

This folder contains the experiment and the stimuli files. There are three sets of stimuli
* SubStimuli-Fake: these are just letters with +/- to indicate the order. Used for programming and testing the experiment only.
* SubStimuli-CCC: these are the original CCC stimuli that were used in 1998 in Cousineau & Shiffrin.
* SubStimuli-MYST: these are newer stimuli, with the same underlying structure (a conjunction of two features is 100% diagnostic).

The experiment was programed using E-Prime 2.0 with the Born-Open extension to make 
the data file available in this repository
