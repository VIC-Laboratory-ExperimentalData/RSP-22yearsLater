# Lines with a # are comments; variable names includes special characters "." and "[]"

# This file contains the columns of the data file;
# note that the one on session 75 contained additional columns that were never used and disables subsequently.
# Each variable is followed after a colon by a short description;
# these variables are typical in E-Prime. Refer to its documentation for more.
